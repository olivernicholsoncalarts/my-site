     His solo work, which he releases under the name <strong>'Muco’</strong> (pronounced Moo-Cho) has been streamed over 1.5 million times worldwide 
      and has been described as “charming”, “compelling”, featuring a “kaleidoscope of contrasts” by Come Here Floyd. 
      DNÜ says Muco finds “a balance between being haunting and spiritual”, with “dreamy production making room for stunning vocals”. 
      Earmilk calls his songwriting “dazzling” and “wistful" with music which “brushes away all your thoughts, 
      leaving just enough space for its alluring lyrics” Listen to his music at the link below
